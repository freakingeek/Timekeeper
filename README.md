# Timekeeper

Timekeeper is an Angular application built to track and manage time-related tasks. It was created as part of a front-end developer test for Payever. The project demonstrates the use of Angular CLI, TypeScript, RxJS and Angular components to develop a basic time tracking interface.

## Features

- Basic UI to manage time entries.
- Appointments are stored in the browser's local storage for persistence.
- Built with Angular 19.1.3 and TypeScript.
